The SELinux Game provides an environment to learn about SELinux by doing it
instead of reading about how to do it. There are a lot of internet resources
that describe how SELinux works, but there aren't many opportunities to try
actually try it.

The SELinux Game presents different scenarios, each with a problem that is
SELinux related. These scenarios simulate a sysadmin being called to look into
a situation they canâ€™t predict. The goal of the player is to demonstrate
SELinux skillz by solving each scenario.

Some of the exercises simulate an intruder on your system, so knowing when to
fix the AVC denial and when to recognize that they are protecting you is part
of it.

The scenarios are run locally using Vagrant, which makes it easy to run. For
more information on this, read the
