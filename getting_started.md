### Setup

1. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

2. Download the [SELinuxGame Vagrantfile]({{ layout.rel_path }}/Vagrantfile) which defines
   all of the Vagrant boxes.

### How it Works

SELinuxGame has two sections: tutorials and scenarios.

The [tutorials section]({{ layout.rel_path }}{% link tutorials.md %}index.html) teaches you about
SELinux without prompting you for an answer. It's a great place to learn how SELinux works and
some practical ways to work with it.

Each scenario in the [scenarios section]({{ layout.rel_path }}{% link scenarios.md %}index.html)
gives you a Vagrant environment and prompts you for a SELinux solution. After you figure out
the solution, send the answer via chat to an SELinuxGame admin to get added to the
[leaderboard]({{ layout.rel_path }}{% link leaderboard.md %}index.html). More details are at the bottom
of each scenario page.
